Explanation of values
=====================


The "status" variable on resource set objects can have four different values:

    * "pending", meaning that the request() method call hasn't been called or
          processed yet
    * "acquired", meaning that the client is allowed to use the requested
          resource
    * "lost", meaning that the client has lost the resource set and is not
          allowed to use it
    * "available", meaning that the client is not allowed to use the resource
          set, but based on the current status the client would get the resource
          set if it did a request() method call

The difference between "lost" and "available" is subtle. One way to
think of the difference is this: when a media player resource set having
an audio resource goes to "lost" state, the media player can dim or gray
out the play button, since the media player is unable to get access to
the resources under any circumstances. This can be the case for instance
during a phone call, depending on murphy configuration. However, if the
media player resource set is in "available" state, the audio playback
can continue when the user or the application wishes so. This can be the
case when another media player application is playing audio. The user
can control which media player will play audio by pushing play button on
the UI of the application that the user wants to play.

The "status" variable on resource objects can have three values:
"pending", "acquired" and "lost". The "available" value is not needed,
since the resources cannot be indiviually requested, only resource sets.
